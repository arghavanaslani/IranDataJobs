# JobAdDB
As I delved deeper into the world of data science, I set my sights on finding a job in the field. However, I quickly noticed that job titles like "data analyst," "data scientist," and "data engineer" were often used interchangeably, making it challenging to understand what each role entailed.

In this rapidly evolving field, such ambiguity is not surprising, but it posed a challenge for someone like me trying to find their footing. I needed a clearer picture of which job descriptions matched these job titles, helping me navigate the data science job market more effectively.

Residing in Iran, I encountered a challenge when seeking an appropriate dataset for my analysis. Unable to find an existing dataset that suited my needs, I took matters into my own hands. This led me to embark on a web scraping project to gather data from jobvision.com pertaining to job postings related to data. The data I collected is from job postings released in August 2023.

In the future, I plan to use this dataset for analysis. In the meantime, feel free to explore and utilize it. I hope this dataset proves useful to those who share my curiosity about this topic!
